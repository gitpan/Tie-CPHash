Tie-CPHash version 1.05, released January 20, 2012


This module provides a case preserving but case insensitive hash.
This means that

    $cphash{KEY}    $cphash{key}
    $cphash{Key}    $cphash{keY}

all refer to the same entry.  Also, the hash remembers which form of
the key was last used to store the entry.  The `keys' and `each'
functions will return the key that was used to set the value.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

While Tie::CPHash should function with any version of Perl 5, the
build system requires at least Perl 5.006.  To install on older
versions of Perl, you'll have to manually copy lib/Tie/CPHash.pm to
your Perl library search path.
